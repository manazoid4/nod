# Piblo feature inventory

Source of truth for "nothing useful gets silently removed". Base: MAZ Pocket **v1.0.2** (tag `nod-v1.0.2-b25`, the build on the physical Cardputer), recovered into Piblo in [PR #16](https://github.com/manazoid4/nod/pull/16).

**Columns:** Code = present in this repo · Build = firmware/Core CI green · Tests = unit tests exist and pass · Device = physically verified (link to [test ledger](docs/evidence/TEST-LEDGER-2026-10-11.md)).
✅ yes · 🟡 partial · ❌ failed · ⬜ not yet checked

**Status:** Preserved (kept as-is) · Restored (was missing from Piblo, brought back) · Improved · Renamed · Moved (now under More/Advanced) · Experimental (branch only, unproven) · Retired (with reason)
